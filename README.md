# HomeAwayLV coding test.

## Description:

This is my submission for HomeAway coding test. Some highlights on the solution are:

* Android Databinding
* MVVM
* RxJava (for UI and HTTP)
* Retrofit - for HTTP client
* SQLite - for persistence
* Glide - for image rendering
* Google maps
* Google Static Maps
* Parceables - to pass the List of Venues to maps

## GitHub
The project is in GitHub under `https://github.com/DigitalOnion/HomeAwayLV.git`

```
https://github.com/DigitalOnion/HomeAwayLV.git
```

You need to clone it to your computer. Open it in Android Studio, build it and execute it. I tested on Emulator and on a real Android device.
